# Home Assistant Dashboard

There's a lot that Home Assistant's Lovelace dashboards are capable of, especially when paired with HACS, but, at the end of the day, it's not easy to force it do exactly what you want. This is my attempt at a completely custom-built dashboard instead, leveraging the official WebSocket library [home-assistant/home-assistant-js-websocket](https://github.com/home-assistant/home-assistant-js-websocket) and [REST APIs](https://developers.home-assistant.io/docs/api/rest) for additional functionality (like historical data).

See [azhu2/home-assistant-setup](https://github.com/azhu2/home-assistant-setup) for my HA setup, including the last iteration of my Lovelace dashboard.
